# Project 1: Shared shopping lists
## Overview
This project is for the course [Web Software Development](https://csfoundations.cs.aalto.fi/web-software-development) at Aalto University.
 
The goal was to build a web application that is used as a shared shopping list. The application uses a three-tier architecture (client, server, database) and a layered architecture with four layers(view, controllers, services and database).

## Launching the application
To launch the application run `docker-compose up`. By default the application starts on the port `7777`and when run locally, can be accessed at `http://localhost:7777`.
